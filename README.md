Hello there! I'm a network and security infrastructure professional with over 20 years of experience working with some top-tier companies and departments, including IBM GSA, Westpac, AUSTRAC, Fujitsu, Leightons, SpeedCast, AWS, and Symbio Networks.

Over the past 25 years, I've developed expertise in cloud infrastructure and security, earning certifications from major cloud vendors in public and private, security, and automation. Recently, I've focused on cloud infrastructure and security automation using tools such as Terraform, Vagrant, Vault, and Ansible. I've had the pleasure of working with clients to transition from legacy or mixed environments to more consistent cloud-based architectures tailored to their unique needs.

On my GitHub profile, you'll find some of my recent work, including contributions to open-source projects and personal projects. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and contributing to the community through my work.

Feel free to check out my profile and explore my projects. I'm always open to questions and opportunities to collaborate.
